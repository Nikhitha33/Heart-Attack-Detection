# Heart Attack Detection using ML

- The purpose of this project is to determine how well different types of Machine Learning Models perform for a given classification problem.
- The Dataset can be obtained [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci).
- The **Jupyter Notebook** with the Analysis is present in the Notebook Folder while the dataset in the Data folder.
- We are also trying to create a **Flask** application to create an Interface so that a common user may access the models.
